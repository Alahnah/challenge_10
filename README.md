Instructions
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

Part 2: Design Your Climate App

References:
Class activities were a big part of where most of my code came from. I also attended office hours on 7/26 to get help with the climate app portion.
This also helped with my app.py section of my code as well as office hours and class activities.
